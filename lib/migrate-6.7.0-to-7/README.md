# PostCSS Preset Env : Migrate from v6.7.0 to v7

- ⚠️ Do not expect the regular level of support on this package ⚠️

Intended to be used as a stop-gap measure until **you** migrate your CSS source code.

As this provided migration support from `postcss-preset-env` v6.7.0 to v7.x there can be no feature request, or bug reports.

Any change to how this package behaves would defeat the purpose of providing a bridge between v6.7.0 to v7.x.
